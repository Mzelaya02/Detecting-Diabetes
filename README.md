# DS160_Final_Project_MAZ
In this project, I found 0 columns with missing values for the data processing. Then, I made the outcome variable independent for the logistic regression model and left the other variables dependent. Next, I  split the dataset into training and test sets. Next, I  trained the logistic regression model and later performed using a confusion matrix, confusion matrix display, and classification report, and predicted new results for each case (row). The best classification report out of my three experiments demonstrates an 87% accuracy in patients who didn't have diabetes and an 86% accuracy in patients who did have diabetes. Lastly, the model did pretty well in detecting whether a patient has diabetes. Still, there is always more room to improve the mode's prediction accuracy.
